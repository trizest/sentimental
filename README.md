Lets be honest, NodeJS is probably the most suitable language because:
    - works well with API's
    - Always on and asynchronous. 

I guess we could use sentiment analysis once its in the DB but thats not the first step

TO DO:

1) look at twitter API and just get it working in a NodeJS sandbox
2) set up a simple DB or DF and stick it in there. Chance to learn postgres?
3) Get python script to pull from DB and analyse and put backa result. 


SIDE IDEA:
- a simple website, that upon request scraps available twitter data and provides sentiment analysis.
